# Flashing your modems
Follow the instructions (here)[https://github.com/DVMProject/dvmfirmware-hs].  Note that most hotspot boards cannot be flashed while directly attached to the Pi, you'll need to use the USB adapter to flash each one.

Once your modems are flashed, power down your Raspberry Pi and connect one as a hat, the other to the USB adapter board.  Make sure the firmware flashing switch on the adapter is  set to "off."
